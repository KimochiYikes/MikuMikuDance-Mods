A mod attempt to move the camera's distance in its FOV (to bypass its limit to only round numbers). 

Intended for game rips. To use, open the latest x64 MikuMikuDance in Cheat Engine, along with the cheat table, and enable all <script> with Render in the name. 

Viewport does not work properly, so the effect will only be visible when it's in Play or in AVI render mode. A rewrite is planned.
